## Introduction

This is the backend API for discovering time-synced Spotify song lyrics that are used by [Lyricstify](https://github.com/lyricstify/lyricstify).

## Installation

Since this project is built on top of Node.js so you need to [download](https://nodejs.org/en/download) and install it before start using this repository. Then, to install this repository you can follow these steps:

- [Clone this repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository)
- Open the project directory and run the following command to install the required dependencies:
  ```bash
  npm install
  ```
- Copy the `.env.example` file to the `.env`
- Inside the `.env` file, pay attention to `SPOTIFY_COOKIE` you need to fill it in based on your Spotify account cookie. Here is how you can get your cookie:
  - Open your browser and open _Developer Tools_ by clicking F12
  - Navigate to the _Network_ tab inside your _Developer Tools_
  - Then visit https://open.spotify.com/ and make sure that you already logged in
  - Inside the _Network_ tab, see the first request to `open.spotify.com`
  - Then see the _Request Headers_ tab, and copy the _cookie_ value inside it
- You can set `APP_ENV` (`development`, `testing`, or `production`), `APP_PORT`, and optionally you can configure Redis connection via variables that have `REDIS_` prefix
- Finally, start the server using the following command:
  ```
  npm run start
  ```
